					<div class='projectInfo'>
						Used <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> to create actual content and design. 
						Technology I used is <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>Node JS</span>, <span>EJS templates</span> and <span>framework Express</span>.
						 There are client-side and server-side form validation. 
						 To communicate with the relational database I used <span>framework ORM - sequelize</span> library.
						 And to install database server - <span>Docker</span>. 
						 Additionaly, there are: user authentication authorization, and also two-languages mechanism (PL | GB).
					</div>

					<span class='projectName'>CovidApp</span>
					a website with information about covid pandemic and a shop
					<div class='projectInfo'>
						This is a project that I realised at university with other students in group work. 
						My responsibilites were: creating <span>covid news</span> - a raport with all covid cases, recoveries, deaths, 
						a map, charts and forms for users . Project is created using <span>React</span>. <span>Covid News</span> contains different
						 components that takes data from Covid API from Postman and updates daily. I created also a chart 
						 using <span>CanvasJSChart</span> (shows percent of countries with most cases).
					</div>

					<span class='projectName'>GameFinal</span>
					a survival-fictional game
					<div class='projectInfo'>
						This game demo is a final university project. It is made using game engine - <span>Unity</span>
						 and writing scripts in <span>C#</span>. Game allows user to explore the word, fight to survive, do quests,
						  build character's skills tree, craft. Project is still in process.
					</div>

					<span class='projectName'>Bison flex</span>
					a code analyzer and calculator for expressions on strings
					<div class='projectInfo'>
						Technology I used is <span>Flex and Bison for C++</span>. 
						The program analyzes the file that is written in specific language and checks it correctness and compatibility.
					</div>

					<span class='projectName'>PrologGame</span>
					a simple criminal, fictional game written in Prolog
					<div class='projectInfo'>
						Game is created using <span>SWI-Prolog</span> to compile and run <span>prolog</span> file. 
						Gameplay is all about writing correct instructions to do some actions (talk to people, collect items, move). 
						The whole idea is to find who is the thief. 
					</div>

					<span class='projectName'>GreedyAlgorithm</span>
					an example algorithm to determine the shortest path.
					<div class='projectInfo'>
						The subject of the project is to implement a heuristic algorithm to calculate the shortest distance conntecting all the cities. 
						Project is a traveling salesman problem. 
						To solve the trouble I used <span>greedy algorithm</span>. It was implemented using <span>Java</span>.
